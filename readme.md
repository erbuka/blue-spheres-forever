# Blue Spheres Forever

A fan remake of Sonic 3 and Sonic&Knuckles special stage, "Blue Spheres". Includes all the original levels, a level editor, and all the Blue Spheres stages can be played by entering the 12-digit code. 

## Building

This repository has submodules, so it has to be cloned recursively:
```
git clone https://github.com/erbuka/blue-spheres-forever --recursive
```

This project uses [Premake](https://premake.github.io/) to generate project files, and for now it can run only on Windows (Linux and Apple builds are on my todo list).

Visual Studio 2019 solution is provided under the *vs2019* folder.

## Roadmap

Major features to be added in the next releases:

- [ ] New Mechanic: Portals
- [ ] Linux version
- [ ] Apple version
- [ ] New Character: Tails
- [ ] New Character: Knuckles
